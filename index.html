  <h2>The Importance of Mental Health Awareness in Schools</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Mental health awareness is an important issue for all educators, who are often the first line of defense for their students. Education professionals have recognized the impact that a student's mental health has on learning and achievement, and they realize that there's a great deal that can be done to help students with mental health issues. As a high school teacher with more than 23 years of experience, I welcome the fact that mental health awareness is finally becoming an important part of a school's function and curriculum.</p>

  <h2>Seeing the Signs in My Student</h2>
  <br>
  <p>A few years ago, a student in my senior class changed drastically in a short period of time. I noticed that Melina no longer did her homework, and she didn't even try on her essays. Previously meticulous in her appearance, Melina would come to school disheveled, wearing the same clothes. When I tried to speak to her, she was uncharacteristically distant and withdrawn. Because I had some training in mental health awareness, I knew Melina was in some sort of trouble.</p>

  <h2>Spreading Awareness Across the Nation
  </h2><br>
  <p>Until mental health education is a mandatory aspect of all schools, teachers and administrators can work to promote awareness with their students. Key elements to shine a light on include the concept of self-care and responsibility for one's own mental health and wellness, with an emphasis on the fact that mental health is an integral part of health, and the concept of recovery from mental illness.

    Teachers and students should be provided with ways to recognize signs of developing mental health problems, and there should be opportunities around the awareness and management of mental health crises, including the risk of suicide or self-harm. Further, instruction should address the relationship between mental health, substance abuse, and other negative coping behaviors, as well as the negative impact of stigma and cultural attitudes toward mental illness.</p>

        Another benefit to focusing on mental health awareness is that it can make signs and symptoms of certain conditions more well-known. Early intervention is predictive of how successful mental health treatment will be for many conditions. The earlier someone is diagnosed and begins treatment, the more likely it is that theyâ€™ll be able to manage their condition and improve their mental health.</p>

  <H2>About us:
  </H2>
  <p>
    Mental health is a level of psychological well-being or an absence of mental illness.  It's the psychological state of someone who is functioning at a satisfactory level of  emotional and behavioral adjustment. 
It includes subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence,  intergenerational dependence, and self-actualization of one's intellectual and  emotional potential, among others.
This list compiles several self-help resources we've personally found useful for a  range of mental health problems, but in no way are they a replacement for professional help, psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy. We're not experts, and  even if we were, most of these tools are meant as an aid to therapy, not as a  substitute. 
The idea is to create a platform for the people dealing with such issues to come forward and discuss openly about their issues and will be provided with every possible help. This platform will help people discuss and get help from the comfort of their home without any need to go out in public and discuss it. 
<br><br><br>
As per the attempt of the project is to help people with mental health issues come forward and seek for help. This issue that we are facing today is way bigger than we think. The number of patients are increasing day by day and the most of these numbers are coming from the working class and educational class of society. Kids from the age of 11 to adults of the age 55 are the most common patients of mental health. 

The main focus of this project is to bridge a gap between the patients that shy out to ask for help and the people who can actually help them overcome this.
<br><br><br>

The scope of the project is to help more and more people and create a healthier and safer environment. This project will help the people get knowledge about how to deal with such problems. The idea is to research and make our services better so that more and more people can be helped.
